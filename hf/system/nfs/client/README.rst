Example Playbook

Including an example of how to use your role (for instance, with variables passed in as parameters) is always nice for users too:

Create file inventory with all your target clients
[clients]
192.168.0.16

Create file playbook.yml with the list of export on the target servers

---
- hosts: clients
  become: true
  roles:
    - roles/hf/system/nfs/client
  vars:
    nfsmounts:
      - src: 192.168.0.26:/mnt/b026_02/nfs_backup
        path: /mnt/nfsc_backup
        owner: a
        group: a
      - src: 192.168.0.26:/mnt/b026_02/nfs_document
        path: /mnt/nfsc_document
        owner: a
        group: a


Then run the command
‚ùØ ansible-playbook -i ./inventory playbook.yml --ask-become-pass
